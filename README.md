The is the repository for my final exam project code submission.
The exam was followed by a detailed report which is omitted.

The code is run entirely in the one file, as was specified in the project description
The purpose of the code is to train multiple models on a selected dataset to achieve the optimal results

The two files '.csv' accompanying the main '.py' file are the datasets that the model
is trained on. These datasets are supplied and owned by the Kaggle website, made public as 
part of the 'Spaceship Titanic' open competition and free to use.
