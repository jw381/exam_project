INTRO
------
The is the repository for my final exam project code submission.
The exam was followed by a detailed report which is omitted here.


FILES
------
The code is run entirely in one file, as was specified in the project's original description.

The two '.csv' files accompanying the main '.py' file are the datasets that the model is trained on. These datasets are supplied and owned by the Kaggle website, made public as part of the 'Spaceship Titanic' open competition and free for general use.


PURPOSE
------
The goal of the project was to be able to classify which of the passengers aboard the spaceship titanic were transported to another dimension and which were still present. This is a fictional recreation of the titanic dataset in which passengers are classified based on whether or not they survived the event.

The machine learning algorithms employed were the Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier.
